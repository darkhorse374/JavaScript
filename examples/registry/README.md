# Registry Example

This is an example of what a registry might look like

Here different blocks depend on each other and import dependencies. And jsrepo is responsible for handling all of that correctly.

We use this to test the functionality of the `build` command.

To test this example run:

```bash
pnpm install

pnpm build:registry
```

<DocHeader

	description="Share your code with less friction than ever before."
/>
<p>
	<Jsrepo /> allows you to build your own registry making sharing your code frictionless. <Jsrepo />
	was born from a desire to move away from an excessive amount of npm packages that both bloat your project
	and give up control.
</p>
<p>
	<Jsrepo /> takes inspiration from tools like <Link target="_blank" href="https://ui.shadcn.com/">
		shadcn-ui
	</Link> allowing you to only bring it what you need while making it almost as easy as just installing
	an npm package.

	<Jsrepo /> was born from a desire to move away from an excessive amount of npm packages that both bloat
	your project and take away control.
</p>
<p>
	Taking inspiration from tools like <Link target="_blank" href="https://ui.shadcn.com/">
		shadcn-ui
	</Link>, <Jsrepo /> allows you to only bring in what you need while making it almost as easy as just
	installing an npm package.

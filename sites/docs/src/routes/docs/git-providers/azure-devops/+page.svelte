<SubHeading>Branches and Tags</SubHeading>
<p>
	Because the <Link target="_blank" href="https://bitbucket.org">AzureDevops</Link> URL structure doesn't
	include enough information to fetch raw files we have to use a custom structure so copy pasting the
	URL from the homepage like you can for other providers won't just work.
</p>
<p>Instead you need to follow the following format:</p>
<Code hideLines lang="diff" code={`azure/<organization>/<project>/<repo>/(tags|heads)/<ref>`} />
<Code
	hideLines
	lang="bash"
	code={`azure/ieedan/std/std # default branch shorthand
azure/ieedan/std/std/tags/v1.5.0 # tag reference
azure/ieedan/std/std/heads/next # branch reference
`}
/>
<SubHeading>Using Tags for Versioning</SubHeading>
<p>
	Tags can be a great solution to ensuring remote tests and blocks stay on a consistent version.
</p>
<Code
	lang="json"
	code={`{
	"$schema": "https://unpkg.com/jsrepo@${data.version}/schemas/project-config.json",
    // use a specific version tag
	"repos": ["azure/ieedan/std/std/tags/v1.5.0"],
	"path": "src/blocks",
	"includeTests": false,
	"watermark": true,
	"formatter": "prettier",
	"paths": {
		"*": "./src/blocks"
	}
}`}
/>
<p>
	Tags do not however work like npm packages. Tags are completely mutable meaning a malicious
	registry could publish over a tag with different code.
</p>
<p>This is why it's always important to make sure you trust the owner of the registry.</p>
